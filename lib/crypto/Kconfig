	  Declares whether the architecture provides an arch-specific

	  This symbol can be depended upon by arch implementations of the
	  Curve25519 library interface that require the generic code as a
	  fallback, e.g., for SIMD implementations. If no arch specific
	  implementation is enabled, this implementation serves the users
	  of CRYPTO_LIB_CURVE25519.

	  Enable the Curve25519 library interface. This interface may be
	  fulfilled by either the generic implementation or an arch-specific
	  one, if one is available and enabled.
